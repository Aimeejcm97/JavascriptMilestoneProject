# JavascriptMilestoneProject
Interactive front end project
UX
for my project I aimed to create a working calculation system that would allow it's users to quickly solve equations as well as providing an area to keep notes on any equations solved using the site. I also wanted to keep the visuals of the website simple and the colours muted as to allow for long periods of use without causing long term strain on the eyes of users. Examples of uses for this site are:

A student could use the site to help them check answers for their mathematic schoolwork.
A buisness owner could calculate profits on items for sale on the site whilst keeping track of the items and their profit value in the notes section to copy and paste to an external document easily.
A self-employed worker could use the site to calculate their income taxes and keep running notes on each months earnings.
An employer calculating staff wages based on hours worked in the month.



Features
Existing Features
Dropdown selection menu allows users to select from addition subtraction multiplication and division for their equations.
A built in text area allows users to make notes about their equations on the page instead of needing to flip between tabs.
A darker muted colour scheme reduces strain on the eyes if user is using the site for an extended period.

Possible future features
A possible future feature could be adding scientific calculation operators to allow for a wider range of calculations.

Technologies Used
Vanilla HTML,CSS and Javascript were used to make this project.

Testing
In order to test my code I send a link to the browser to friends and family so that i could have multiple viewpoints on what i could change or what was showing up errors and may need to be fixed.

Deployment
I developed my code using repl.it in order to easily identify any errors or mistakes that would crop up during the development then downloaded and saved them in a seperate folder on my computer for safety then uploaded them to github and deployed the site using github pages.


Credits
I recived my inspiration for this project from my mother who always complains about having to keep track of her tabs when she is trying to calculate her income tax for her buisness.
